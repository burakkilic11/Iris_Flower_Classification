# Iris Flower Classification
Machine Learning Project

Welcome to this GitHub repository, a comprehensive guide to Iris flower classification. The Iris flower dataset is a well-known benchmark in machine learning, featuring three species: Versicolor, Sentosa, and Virginica. Each species is defined by four attributes: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

This repository offers two distinct methods for classifying Iris flowers. The first method is detailed in a Jupyter notebook titled ‘IRIS flower classification.ipynb’. This notebook utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, a popular choice for classification tasks. It covers every step of the process, from data loading to model training and evaluation, concluding with testing on new data.

The second approach is implemented in an ‘app.py’ file, housing a Streamlit web application that employs the Random Forest algorithm for classification. Random Forest is known for its accuracy and ability to prevent overfitting. The app provides an interactive platform for users to classify Iris flowers based on their attributes.
